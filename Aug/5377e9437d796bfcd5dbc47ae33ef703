Athletics Kenya has said it will set up an oversight committee that will deal with the doping menace in the country. This is after the federation met with affiliates and chairmen from branches across the country in a bid to help sort out the issue. At the same time, AK president Jackson Tuwei has said it is unfortunate that billions are unaccounted for in the auditor general's report on the IAAF world under championships that took place in Nairobi in 2017.
