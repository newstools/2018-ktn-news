The Kenya National Schools and Colleges Drama Festival ends today. Many of the teams that won in preliminary announcements by adjudicators yesterday said they owed their triumph to hard work during rehearsals, characterisation, message development and simplicity in communicating with entertainment value. Kakamega High School's play, The Burdens and Butere Girls' School play, It Is Well, scooped the Best Costumes and Best Production awards respectively in preliminary reports announced by adjudicators. There was no doubt Karima Girls School brought a fresh edge to the fete in the play, Animal City Animosity, by Jospeh Murungu, and deservedly made it to the gala. The play depicts an animal kingdom where a power struggle leads to assassinations. What was new was the use of masks, great acting from the main characters and a great deal of recreating the wilderness on stage.
