Five people, among them three police officers, sustained bullet injuries after chaos erupted during the burial of the driver of Likuyani Member of Parliament Enoch Kibunguchy in Kiminini, in the county of Trans Nzoia. Trouble began when Kakamega county chief officer in charge of Sports Robert Kundu Makhanu arrived at the funeral but was heckled and chased away by rowdy mourners.
