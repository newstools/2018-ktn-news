A Cabinet secretary and a parliamentary committee chairman engaged in a war of words yesterday over the Sh3.2 billion Ruaraka land saga. The bitter exchanges between Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and Senate Public Accounts and Investment Committee Chairman Moses Kajwang’ came on a day the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and Directorate of Criminal Investigations engaged in a feud of their own over the same matter. This highlights the intrigues that have shrouded the probe. The long-running investigation has seen two Cabinet secretaries appear to indict Dr Matiang’i. This coupled with the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has returned the file to EACC on three occasions, in the past two months, highlight the complex nature of the probe. Yesterday, the committee called off a hearing after Matiang’i failed to turn up. The CS, through an aide, later said he was not aware of the invitation to appear before the MPs. He alleged a political scheme to drag his name into questionable dealings. “There was no invite to the CS, and if they insist there was one tell them to show you the letter. Standing Orders also require that a witness is given at least seven days to appear, so even if the said letter was there they never gave him the required time,” said Interior Ministry Director of Communication Mwenda Njoka.
