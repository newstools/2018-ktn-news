When Taj Shopping Mall launched seven years ago, everything appeared to have gone right. Rameshchandra Gorasia, the owner, could not have asked for a better location for the business. It was at the intersection of Outering Road, Airport North Road and Airport South Road, hence easily accessible. After its launch in August 2011, the four-storey mall, which is valued at Sh5.5 billion, boasted of immense success. It hosted businesses such as Uchumi Supermarket and Bata, which brought in high traffic. This was until the National Land Commission, in a joint initiative with the Kenya Urban Roads Authority nbsp;announced that part of the establishment would be demolished as it stood on land that was illegally acquired. Now, the mall is set for a relaunch on January 19. And the establishmentâ€™s owner and director hopes the move will turn around its dwindling fortunes. Already, the name has changed from Taj Shopping Mall to Airgate Centre and renovation works are in progress to transform the now dreary face of the building premises.
