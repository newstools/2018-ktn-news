A political showdown looms in the National Assembly this week, as members remain sharply divided on whether the probe on sugar should be revived or not. A section of lawmakers has already supported a motion by Saboti MP Caleb Amisi to form an ad?hoc committee that will investigate and report within 21 days on whether the sugar in circulation has mercury or not. It is a move that has been opposed vehemently by some of their colleagues.
