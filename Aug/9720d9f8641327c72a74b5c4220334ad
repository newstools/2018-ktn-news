Cabinet secretaries Henry Rotich and Adan Mohammed may have to fight for their survival in Cabinet as their names are adversely linked to the mercury-laden sugar imports. Treasury forecast, says CBK If the National Assembly approves a report with adverse recommendations against them concerning the bad sugar, they could be forced to step aside. Mr Rotich, the Treasury Cabinet secretary, is in trouble for opening a window for duty-free sugar imports that was abused by unscrupulous traders. And Mr Adan, who was Trade CS at the time of the scandal, faces censure because a State agency that should have prevented an influx of contraband sugar failed in its duty. The joint House committee that investigated the scandal has recommended immediate investigations against the two CSs, and if the report is approved by the House, it could trigger a series of events that could culminate in them having to step aside. The MPs also want the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to probe former Agriculture CS Willy Bett, currently Kenyaâ€™s High Commissioner to India, over his involvement in the sugar imports, some of which have been found to be unfit for human consumption. In a report tabled in the House yesterday, the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Trade further recommended destruction of all sugar found unfit for human consumption.
