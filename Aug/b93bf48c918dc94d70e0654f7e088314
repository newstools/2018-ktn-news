The Kenya National Schools and Colleges Drama Festival ends today. Many of the teams that won in preliminary announcements by adjudicators yesterday said they owed their triumph to hard work during rehearsals, characterisation, message development and simplicity in communicating with entertainment value. Kakamega High School's play, The Burdens and Butere Girls' School play, It Is Well, scooped the Best Costumes and Best Production awards respectively in preliminary reports announced by adjudicators.
