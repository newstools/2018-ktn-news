The hunger strike at the industrial area remand and allocation prison has entered it’s second day yesterday with the detainees claiming their grievances had not been addressed. Leaked pictures from the highly guarded prison showed an inmate living with disability with scars of alleged brutality.  KTN News cannot ascertain the authenticity of the pictures.  Meanwhile, the prison officials have since denied the claims with some stating that the remandees are protesting a change of guard and confiscation of their phones and other contraband items within the facility.
