Speaker Muturi wants the MPs who have readily admitted that money changed hands for the demise of the report to record official statements. “I have instructed the Clerk of the National Assembly to immediately write to the members who have been quoted in sections of the media citing incidences of bribery within the precincts of parliament; inviting them to share their testimonies or any information that they may have with the Powers and Privileges Committee,” said Muturi. According to the speaker, the Powers and Privileges Committee will review the information to ascertain the possibilities of breach of privilege by the way of unethical conduct on the part of specific Members of the National Assembly. “The Powers and Privileges Committee will upon evaluation of the testimonies may consider inviting the competent investigatory agencies, in particular the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) as provided for in the Leadership and Integrity Act to conclusively handle the investigations with the view to taking necessary action against any member found culpable of this grossly unethical conduct,” he said.
