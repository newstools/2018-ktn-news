The last surviving black rhino of the 11 translocated to the Tsavo East national park in June has died. The animal's condition worsened Saturday with Kenya wildlife service veterinary officers treating wounds inflicted on it late last month when a pride of lions attacked it. The death has exposed negligence of proportional magnitude on the part of the KWS with a probe into the ten previous deaths released on July 26 pointing to professional negligence.
