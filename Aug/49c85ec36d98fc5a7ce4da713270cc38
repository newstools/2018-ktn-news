A section of leaders drawn from the Muslim community have called for the removal of Chief Khadi Ahmed Muhdhar over the confusion in commemoration of Idd-Ul-Adha.
Muhdhar had called on Muslim faithful in the country to mark the day on August 22 despite Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i declaring August 21 as the day of the event.
