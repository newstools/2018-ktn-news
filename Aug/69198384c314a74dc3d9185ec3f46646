Members of the National Assembly failed to debate findings of a report on the inquiry into the alleged importation of illegal and contaminated sugar in the country. This was afterÂ a section of members of the joint committee on trade and agriculture raised an uproar over a possible attempt to cover up and shield three cabinet secretaries from prosecution. The committee chairman Kanini Kega told KTN News that the matter had been brought to his attention and an amended report holding the three CSs culpable will be tabled next week.
