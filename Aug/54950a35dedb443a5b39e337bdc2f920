A section of political leaders from western Kenya among them senate speaker Ken Lusaka, CS Eugene Wamalwa, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula held another strategy meeting at a Nairobi hotel. The meeting which brought together over 30 lawmakers resolved to throw their weight behind national assembly majority whip Benjamin Washiali who reportedly briefed the leaders that he has been threatened over his stand on the probe on alleged contraband sugar. The leaders fully backed calls for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry for a fresh probe.
