Football Kenya Federation has refuted claims that three kenyan players are among the 12 caught in the attempted age cheating at the u17 football AFCON qualifiers in Tanzania. An MRI scan by CAF nabbed the three to be above the required age bracket.This comes in the wake of FKF having conducted a similar exercise before the team departed for Tanzania. Caf vice president of medical committee, Yacine Zerguini also sent home three Ugandan players while host Tanzania had two overage players.Â  The Kenyan federation has written to both CAF and the hospital that performed the MRI tests, to resolve the matter
