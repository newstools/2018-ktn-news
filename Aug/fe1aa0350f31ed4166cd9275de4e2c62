Technological changes in the last century have brought about profound change in the types and amounts of foods that people consume and the amount of physical activity in which they engage. One result has been a dramatic (and continuing) increase in bodyweight; at present, 2.1 billion people are overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) worldwide, and 700 million are clinically obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). Overweight and obesity are associated with severe health consequences and decreased quality of life, and have been declared an ‘epidemic’ by the WHO.
