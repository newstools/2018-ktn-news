COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli has taken a swipe at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for failure to investigate corruption issues reported to them. Atwoli said this at the Tom Mboya labor college in Kisumu where he opened a five day international labor organization training workshop for labour union representatives from twenty three African states. Atwoli urged the union leaders to be firm in defending the rights of the workers.
