Less than three weeks before the opening of schools for the first term of the school calendar, parents and students are staring at yet another teachers' strike in January. This follows a strike notice issued today by the Kenya national union of teachers, KNUT, which is accusing the Teacher’s Service Commission of introducing unilateral decisions that it says are negatively affecting the morale of teachers. Teachers wanting to strike, this time not because of pay grievances but working conditions.
