Security bosses in Eastern region have said that a lack of social incorporation of the public in policing may be one of the major reasons officers are turning guns to themselves and family members. Speaking during a police party in Mbeere South sub county, the police bosses in the region welcomed the government's move to migrate police officers from the traditional police camps into the community, where they can better relate with the public. Each of the officers will get a house allowance of eight thousand shillings and a commuter allowance of four thousand Kenya shillings, summing up to twelve thousand shillings a month.
