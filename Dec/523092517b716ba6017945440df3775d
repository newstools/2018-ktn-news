A Nairobi court has ordered for a preservation of Meru senator Mithika Linturi's Runda home until Monday when the court will rule on the issue of protection of property belonging to the senator and his estranged wife Maryanne Keitany. The same court ordered Keitany to collect all her belongings from the home by 5pm Monday after a series of domestic confrontations that saw Keitany evicted from the home two days ago by persons described by her lawyer as goons. The two have been embroiled in a bitter divorce that saw Keitany move to court seeking to be allocated a 50% stake in all properties owned by the couple which she says was acquired during the course of their 12?year marriage even though Linturi through his lawyers says they never legally got married.
