Civilian gun holders will undergo a fresh verification exercise of their firearm certificates beginning the 17th of this month. Interior cabinet secretary Dr. Fred Matiangâ€™i has directed firearm holders to appear in person and avail their weapons before the firearms licensing board for review after which they will be issued with new smart licenses. Those in illegal possession of weapons have been given a 90?day moratorium to surrender the weapons or face the law.
