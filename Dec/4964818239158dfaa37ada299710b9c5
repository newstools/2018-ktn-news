Controversy surrounding the partenity of the late professor George Saitoti’s son Zachary Musengi Saitoti has re?emerged after a retired teacher from subukia threatened to move to court seeking to compel the justice system to force a DNA test on himself and Saitoti’s wife Margaret. Sebastian Maina Ngunju says despite the fact that a similar legal onslaught to have him declared as the biological father of Saitoti’s son Zachary was thwarted by the court of appeal last year, he now has renewed confidence in the office of the director of public prosecutions.
