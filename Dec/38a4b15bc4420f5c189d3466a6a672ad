Opposition Cheif Raila Odinga has defended President Uhuru Kenyatta’s move to appoint former Vice President Moody Awori as the chairman of the sports art and social development fund. According to Odinga old age does not mean that someone cannot positively contribute to the country’s development and that Moody Awori is a self-sufficient man who does not have the urge to loot from public coffers. Odinga was speaking in Westlands when he graced the football finals of the Tim Wanyonyi super cup organized by the area MP Tim Wanyoinyi.
