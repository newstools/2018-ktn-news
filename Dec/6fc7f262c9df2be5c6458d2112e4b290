ODM's disciplinary committee has recommended that Malindi Member of Parliament Aisha Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori be expelled from the orange party for gross misconduct.  Also recommended for expulsion are six members of the Homa Bay county assembly following recent acts of violence, unruly behavior and disobedience to party decisions. The national executive committee which adopted the report shall invite the 8 members to appear before it at a special NEC meeting early next year prior to the final decision being taken.
