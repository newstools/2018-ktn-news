The botched ban on matatus entering the Nairobi central business district has once again thrust the management of Nairobi County into the limelight. Â The one day ban that saw hundreds of city commuters stranded was blamed on the Nairobi county government's decision not to involve stakeholders in the transport industry. And now the city boss Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko is being accused of running a one man show. Sonko who was elected with an overwhelming majority has faced a rough first year in office, with his deputy resigning barely 6 months into office. Critics blame the lack of a deputy governor and Sonko's leadership style on some of the problems facing the city.
