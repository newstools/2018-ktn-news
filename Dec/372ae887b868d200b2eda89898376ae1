Security officers and peace?building elders in West Pokot have recovered 5 cows that were stolen by suspected bandits along the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties. In a peace meeting that was held at Sarmach, West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said Turkana and Pokot communities have made big strides in steering peaceful co?existence by returning stolen livestock unlike in the past. This comes after leaders from the two communities on Tuesday last week met at Kainuk in Turkana County and resolved to end the new wave of cattle theft and killings that has claimed six people in the last two months. West Pokot governor Prof John Lonyangapuo was also at the meeting.
