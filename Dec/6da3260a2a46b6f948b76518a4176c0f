Rape and/or defilement has been termed as not only a crime against one's body but also the height of human rights violation. Â It is a crime with long?term effects and its scars remain long after the inhuman act has ended. Mombasa County continues to record high numbers of incidents of rape and sadly children are the ones mostly bearing the brunt of this atrocity, more often than not, the act being carried out by people known to them. As the world observes 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, these victims are banking on the resilience of the human spirit to get their lives back on track.
