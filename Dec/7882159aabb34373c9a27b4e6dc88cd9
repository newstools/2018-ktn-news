Cabinet Secretary for Petroleum and Mining John Munyes has told the Senate committee on energy that the tendering and execution of the Kisumu oil jetty project was above board and that the government did not lose any money.  Munyes said the project was a presidential directive following an East Africa community head of state meeting where leaders agreed to construct an oil jetty in Kisumu for efficient transfer of oil products in the region. Munyes disclosures come just a day after five top Kenya pipeline company managers, including former md, Joe Sang, were arraigned in court and denied three counts relating to the loss of 1.9 billion shillings in the project.
