County assemblies riddled with unending conflicts and disagreements have been urged to seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms other than the courts. This was the message passed across by participants who were attending A?3 day workshop convened by the intergovernmental relations technical committee in Kisumu. This they say is the only way of ensuring harmony and a good working relationship prevailed. Participants also want the intergovernmental relations committee made independent to make it a neutral arbiter whenever there is a conflict between the county and national governments.
