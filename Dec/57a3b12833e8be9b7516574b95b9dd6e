Business came to a standstill in Kuresoi, Nakuru County after residents stormed a brewing den after a 55 year old man died after consuming illicit liquor at the den. Residents are now calling for the transfer of the local police officers who they accuse of receiving bribes from the distillers and doing little to fight illicit brews in the area. This year Kuresoi alone has lost over 5 people due to killer brews distilled in the area.
