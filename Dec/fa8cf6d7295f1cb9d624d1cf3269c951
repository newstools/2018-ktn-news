A story that defies wildlife norm. The story of Michelle ? the  ostrich. Rescued from being swept away by flood waters by a form one student, the bird has refused to go back to the wild and is now perfectly at home with a family in Isinya, in the county of Kajiado. Michelle likes ugali, has a huge appetite and is the tallest in the Muteleu homestead.
