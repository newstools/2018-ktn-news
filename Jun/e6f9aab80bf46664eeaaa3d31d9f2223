47 NYS suspects will have to wait until tomorrow to know if their sureties will be approved by the court or not. This is after the DPP wrote to the Directorate of criminal of investigation directed that the sureties must be approved by the DCIO. The prosecution told the anti-corruption court that some of the sureties presented for approval are proceeds of crime and therefore should not be approved by the court. But the defense lawyers opposed the assertion by the prosecution and challenged them to prove allegations. Presiding magistrate Lawrence Kombo Mugambi will rule on the matter tomorrow. The suspects were granted bail on Monday but have been unable to raise the huge sums of money since their accounts were frozen.
