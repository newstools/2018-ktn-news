The details of the salary deal that will see the highest paid university academic staff take home up to Sh1 million in accumulated arrears can now be revealed. The lowest paid professor who earns Sh144,672 will now take home Sh170,050 a month. This translates to accrued arrears of Sh745,953, which must be paid by the end of June this year. And the least paid academic staff – an assistant lecturer – will now earn Sh82,037, up from Sh69,794, with the highest paid set to take home Sh117,121, up from Sh99,642. All university academic staff members will enjoy a house allowance of 3.9 per cent. Assistant lecturers will earn a flat rate of Sh51,061 a month as professors take home Sh73,715. It also means that all university academic staff members will enjoy a salary increase of 17.5 per cent. "Payment of eligible academic members of staff shall be effected in full on a date not later than June 30, 2017," reads the return-to-work formula signed by the unions and university managements. No worker will be victimised for taking part in the strike and each of them will receive their full salaries. "The strike period shall be recognised as time worked so that all benefits and entitlements accrue without interruption, including but not limited to leave entitlements, salaries for January, February, and March 2017," reads the document. Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga yesterday said the deal was the best under the circumstances. "We were running out of time because we should start talks for the 2017-2021 CBA and they had agreed to harmonise the salaries for all workers. It is a good deal," said Wasonga. The details emerged a day after Uasu signed a Sh6 billion collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with public universities. However, the workers of Maasai Mara University will only receive a salary increase of 12.9 per cent because their salaries were higher than those of their colleagues in other universities. Maasai Mara staff will also not get an increase in house allowance because their rates are higher. Payment schedules for the staff seen by The Standard reveal the salary adjustments for assistant lecturers, lectures, senior lecturers, associate professors, and full professors.
