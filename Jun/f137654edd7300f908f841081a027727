President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced that all Government officials and their families will undergo a lifestyle audit as he takes the war against corruption a notch higher. While reaffirming his commitment to fighting graft, Uhuru said he and his deputy William Ruto would also undergo the same audit. “All the governors and Cabinet secretaries will be audited after the two of us before all other Government officials are subjected to the same exercise,” Uhuru said during a visit to Mombasa Thursday. The President was at the coast to officially open the first phase of the Dongo Kundu Bypass, an 11km road connecting Miritini, Mwache and Kipevu. He said he would not hesitate to send Cabinet secretaries or governors found guilty of graft to jail, declaring the war against the theft of public resources was unstoppable. “We are aware some of these corrupt individuals have registered their wealth, including cars and houses, in the names of their spouses and children. We will go for them also,” said Uhuru.
