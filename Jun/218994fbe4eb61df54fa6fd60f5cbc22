Stella Nyanzi a prominent academic in Uganda has gained a reputation for repeatedly criticizing President Yoweri Museveni and his government on social media in posts that are often mingled with sexual obscenities. The academic and activist has made ripples in a conservative country where people often shy away from openly condemning leaders. Critics say hostility to dissent is growing in Uganda; anti?government protests are rarely permitted in Uganda and are often dispersed by police beatings, teargas and the detention of activists. Nyanzi has emerged as a fearless and bold crusader of human rights earning a large following online and in local media.
