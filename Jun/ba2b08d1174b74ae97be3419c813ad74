Deputy president William Ruto today visited Laikipia county where 2022 succession politics took centre stage. Local leaders vowed to back the DP for the top position although the deputy president avoided speaking on the issue. He instead urged Kenyans to embrace peace and reconciliation saying they should not be divided along tribal or religious grounds.
