A new twist was introduced into the ongoing parliamentary probe on contraband sugar when chairman of Rai Group and West Kenya sugar company limited, Jaswant Rai accused four companies and a miller for allegedly selling non?processed sugar to unsuspecting consumers. Rai alleged that Stuntwave limited, Grainergy Kenya limited, the commodity house limited and Hyder (P) limited repackaged and sold unprocessed brown sugar that was imported in bulk on their behalf by Holbud limited contrary to import regulations.  Earlier, interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiangi told lawmakers that some of the illicit and contraband goods imported into the country, including sugar and cooking oil, were contaminated with harmful chemicals.
