A multi?agency team has been tasked to investigate the cause of the Gikomba market fire that claimed the lives 15 people on Thursday morning. Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has said the team, which is led by the directorate of criminal investigation, is investigating the matter. He said the probe will also help in finding a lasting solution for the perennial fire outbreaks at Gikomba and Korogocho markets. Speaking when he paid a visit to the victims of the fire, who have been admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital, Sonko warned that if individuals are found culpable of being behind the incidences they will face the full wrath of the law. It is alleged that the recent fire incidents at Gikomba, could be cases of arson.
