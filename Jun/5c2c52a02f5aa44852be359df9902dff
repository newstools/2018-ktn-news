The two leaders at the center of the brutal civil war in South Sudan, which has plunged the world’s youngest nation into a humanitarian crisis, have met face to face for peace talks for the first time in several years. South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, met Wednesday night with his former vice president, Riek Machar, who leads the country’s main opposition forces, in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Wednesday was characterized by hugs and handshakes but the main question is will these gesture bring a lasting peace to south Sudan. This is Bottomline Africa.
