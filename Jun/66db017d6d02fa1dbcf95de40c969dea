Nairobi woman rep Esther Passaris now wants the county government of Nairobi to focus on serving the people of Nairobi and avoid petty differences. Speaking during a forum for public participation at Camp Toyoyo, Passaris said politicking within the city was hampering service delivery and called for unity among various leaders. Passaris says the city of Nairobi being the capital should be an example to the rest 46 counties. Nairobi is yet to get a deputy governor after the exit of Polycarp Igathe several months ago.
