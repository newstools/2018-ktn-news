Owners of residential and commercial buildings in Mombasa’s Central Business District have been ordered to paint their premises with a uniform colour. In a notice issued to residents, the county administration has directed that all buildings be painted white with blue colour ? which symbolizes the Indian Ocean. The owners are also required to clean and refurbish their properties so it is up to decency, health and safety standards. Those who fail to comply with the directive have been warned of dire consequences. The Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers have hailed the plan saying it will be the cheapest way of beautifying the tourism hub.
