Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) has urged the youth in Busia county to seize the opportunities created by the investment in the multi?billion shilling Kisumu brewery to uplift their economic wellbeing. Speaking at an entrepreneurship summit hosted in partnership with the county government of Busia, KBLâ€™s head of engagement and sustainability Jean Kiarie Ngumo urged the youth to embrace sorghum farming as well as senator keg retail as the region gears up for launch of the Kisumu brewery, which comes into operation later this year. KBL is working with thousands of farmers from Busia, Migori, Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya to grow white sorghum, the main raw material for the production of Senator Keg. The Kisumu brewery will initially produce senator keg made using locally?sourced sorghum and KBL targets to recruit over 15,000 sorghum farmers in the next 5 years offering a guaranteed market for the crop.
