Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has rubbished claims linking president Uhuru Kenyatta’s younger brother to the sugar importation saga. Kiunjuri says Muhoho Kenyatta’s company protech investment limited never imported a grain of sugar. The CS says the company applied to be licensed as an importer in 2011 but never got a response from the agriculture and food authority. But how did the company’s name get into the list of importers that Kiunjuri tabled before a joint parliamentary committee?
