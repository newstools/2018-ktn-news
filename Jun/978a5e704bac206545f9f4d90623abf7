Ahead of the budget, the management of Keroche Breweries which is the second largest liquor producer in the country is crying foul over the high?tax?burden on players in the sector. The Naivasha based company is warning of major losses in the sector if the government increases taxes in the sector on Thursday when the budget will be read.
