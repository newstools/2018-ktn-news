The construction of the standard gauge railway has earned Kenya praise from regional heads of state. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame say Kenya has made the biggest impact yet in the transportation of passengers and cargo.  The heads of state spoke at the 14th summit on the northern corridor integration where president Museveni had a special apology from Ugandans to Kenyans.
