The first suspects of the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal are expected in court this week as investigating agencies complete their work. In an indication that arrests may be carried out as early as today, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) forwarded 10 files to Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji early Sunday morning. Mr Haji received the files at 12.43am with recommendations to charge at least 48 individuals drawn from senior management at NYS and National Treasury, as well as suppliers. The suspects face charges that include forgery, money laundering, abuse of office, obtaining by false pretence and fraud. However, it is not automatic that all 48 will be charged immediately because after the DPP peruses the files, he has the power to either direct the DCI to re-investigate, close a file in case of insufficient evidence or even turn some suspects into State witnesses. Haji said they were studying the paperwork.
