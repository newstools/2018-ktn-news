A Government Chemist report has shown part of recently seized consignment of contraband sugar contains mercury and copper. Interior Cabinet Secretar Fred Matiangi said analysis of the sugar had found out it is unfit for human consumption yet it was seized from the markets. “It is shocking that some of this sugar has been found to contain particles of mercury and copper, which is very dangerous to our lives,” he said. Matiangi at the same time warned unnamed senior people against calling or threatening the team behind the crackdown on contraband goods in the country. “If you want to call someone to help or stop the seizure of this illegal goods call the president. Don’t call police or me in the operation. It doesn’t matter how far high you are or which political side you are,” he said without elaborating who had been calling to intimidate the officers. He vowed to intensify the war against illicit trade saying millions of lives were at risk. “I am shocked personally over what we’re doing to our country. Its mind boggling,” Matiangi said at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters where the report was released. The CS also paraded some 1,365 bags of contraband sugar that was seized from a warehouse in Ruiru. Another batch of the goods had been seized in Eastleigh and Industrial Area in Nairobi. Machines used to package and repackage the illegally imported sugar were also impounded in the police raids. Preliminary findings had shown the sugar was imported using a licensed sugar factory based in Western Kenya and those behind it claim it was genuine. They had Kenya Bureau of Standard stickers as an indication of certification for sale in the country.
