It was 1994 and Okello worked at a vernacular radio station, broadcasting in Dholuo, in Kisumu. He had worked at the station owned by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) for slightly over half a decade. Akumu was joining the station fresh from high school. The two first met in the late 1980s when Akumu, an ardent fan of the station’s programmes, visited the radio’s stand at the Kisumu Regional Show in Mamboleo. And when Akumu visited the station weeks later, Okello welcomed him with open arms, accepting to start inducting him into radio broadcasting. The induction went well, and Akumu has since joined KBC where he is a radio presenter at Mayienga Radio, KBC’s Dholuo channel. After KBC, Okello resigned to inaugurate Radio Lake Victoria with his morning show ‘chieng jamondo’. His fame grew further at Radio Ramogi with Dholuo radio programmes such as “Iwacho Awacha” and “Kogwen.” After ensuring that his protege had mastered the art of radio, Okello moved on, rising to become Senator for Migori County in last year’s elections.
