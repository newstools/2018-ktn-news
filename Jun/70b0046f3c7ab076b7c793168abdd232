The government has ordered all heads of procurement and accounting units in all ministries to step aside for vetting in the ongoing war on graft. This comes as a second group of 17 suspects accused of conspiring to defraud the National Youth Service of millions of shillings was arraigned in court today. The total number of those who have appeared in court over the fraud now stands at 39. 22 other suspects were charged last week in connection with the 9 billion shilling loss at the National Youth Service. They include youth affairs principal secretary Lillian Omollo and NYS director general Richard Ndubai who were charged in court on Tuesday.
