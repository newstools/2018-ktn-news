President Uhuru Kenyatta says his younger brother Muhoho Kenyatta should face the law if he was involved in the sugar importation saga. Muhoho’s company Protech Investment Limited is on a list of companies said to have imported sugar during a duty free window last year. The ministry of agriculture has however defended the president’s younger brother saying he never imported a grain of sugar.
