Maasai girlsâ€™ secondary school in Narok County has been closed indefinitely following allegations of sexual harassment of students by their male teachers. It is alleged that after putting up with the said sexual harassment from their male teachers, the girls decided to storm out of the school on Tuesday morning with a view to bringing the matter to the attention of their parents. The incident has elicited anger among parents who have called upon the cabinet secretary for education, Amina Mohamed, to address the matter immediately. Meanwhile investigations into the allegations have commenced even as the school remain closed.
