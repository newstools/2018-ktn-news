The KCPE results released yesterday saw one candidate score 415 marks. But Mary Kamantheâ€™s story is special; she was diagnosed with bone cancer just a month to the exams. She could not walk to class and had to be carried by her father to and from the exam room. Mary who is currently admitted at the coast general hospital still has her sights on her dream school and dream career.
