Air Tanzania's first Boeing's 787 Dreamliner landed at the Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) in Dar es Salaam on Sunday marking a major milestone in the country’s attempt to revitalize its national airline and reintroduce it to international routes. It has long been known that an airline is integral to a country’s development due to ease of logistics and it is this thinking that has driven the move by President John Magufuli’s government to make the airline a cornerstone of development.
