Poachers have killed another rhino at Lake Nakuru National Park barely a month after deaths of other 10 black rhinos following a disastrous translocation by the Kenya Wildlife Service to Tsavo East National Park sanctuary . Senior warden Catherine Wambani confirmed the deaths on Tuesday, as blame game continues between Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala and KWS officials over the deaths.
