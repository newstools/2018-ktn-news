Kibera residents have expressed their displeasure and anger over the ongoing demolitions that began early Monday to pave way for the construction of a link road connecting Lang’ata and Ngong roads. Although they insist they are not opposed to the project, they are accusing the          Kenya urban roads authority for reneging on its earlier undertaking that not any single structure would be demolished until those affected get some financial assistance to allow them resettle.
