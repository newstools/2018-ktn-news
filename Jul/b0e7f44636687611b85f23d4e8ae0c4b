Transport along the busy Landhies Road here in Nairobi has been disrupted for the better part of the morning as police engaged traders in running battles. Police were forced to use tear gas to disperse the protesting traders whose grievances we are yet to establish. The traders had lit bonfires along the road, right from Marikiti market.
