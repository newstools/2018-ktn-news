The Jubilee government plans to create 1.3 million manufacturing jobs by 2022 and achieve a 100 percent health coverage for every Kenyan. This means that an average of 706 jobs will have to be created each day to achieve the 1.29 million target. The government seeks to raise the share of manufacturing sector from nine to 15 percent of the gross domestic product by 2022, expand food production and supply, provide universal health coverage for all Kenyan homes and build 500,000 affordable houses. The Jubilee government lists specific projects and targets that underline its four key pillars — manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing, and food security. Indeed those are President Uhuru Kenyatta’s big 4 agenda. We will delve into the progress of this ambitious Jubilee agenda a little later in this live news broadcast.
