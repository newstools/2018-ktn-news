Pressure is brewing in Nairobi County Assembly following the suspension of several Nairobi County officials among them, Chief of Staff Brian Mugo, acting Chief Officer – Finance Ekaya Alumasi, and acting Head of County Treasury Stephen Mutua. In a statement to newsrooms yesterday, Nairobi governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko implicated the said officers in the misuse of public funds, pending investigations. Sonko further invited the Director of Criminal Investigations to take over the case, stating that suspects found guilty would face the full force of the law.
