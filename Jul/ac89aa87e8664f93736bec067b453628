In what may be an innovative new direction for cultural tourism that not even government has seen coming, a group of more than 80 Italian tourists on Saturday toured a cultural center in Magarini in Kilifi county, to seek divination services from witchdoctors. The Italians from Venice in Italy who are members of a yoga and herbalist group also sought concoctions from the witchdoctors with a view to get to know their problems and get treatment in a colorful and unique ceremony held at the Magarini cultural center. Their visit comes in the eve of the high tourism season which is expected to create a booming business for tourism players and a major breakthrough in the cultural tourism which has never been exploited in the tourism destinations of Kilifi County. Traditionally tourists come on holiday to enjoy the scenic beaches and visit the national parks among other tourism attraction sites. However for the first time a convoy of 10 land cruiser tour vans parked at the remote Magarini cultural center not only to learn the culture but also to seek traditional healing from these witch doctors.
