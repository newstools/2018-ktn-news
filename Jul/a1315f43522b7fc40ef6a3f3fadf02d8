The national land commission has maintained that the disputed Ruaraka land is private. Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri says the NLC approved payment of 1.5 billion shillings for the land only after the attorney general, parliament, the ministry of lands, ministry of education and the courts confirmed that the land was private. Francis Mburu who was paid the money is under investigation by the ethics and anti corruption commission following the compulsory acquisition of the land by the government.
