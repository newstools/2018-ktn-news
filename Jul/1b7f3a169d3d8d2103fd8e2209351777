Construction of Kakamega county's CAT scan centre is almost complete, with projections that completion and handover is just two weeks away. A group of local women who have been monitoring construction in conjunction with the county government have lauded the project saying it was timely. The upgraded centre is located at the Kakamega Teaching and Referral Hospital and is expected to see the population in the county stop going for specialised treatment to exclusive health facilities in Nairobi or even overseas as has been the case previously. This will mean immense savings and even boost the local economy.
