Legislators are planning to introduce a bill in parliament that aims at re?introducing corporal punishment following unrest in schools across the country. More than 40 schools have been set ablaze in recent weeks, leading to indefinite closure of many. National assembly deputy minority whip Chris Wamalwa said members of parliament  are thinking seriously about re?introducing canning as a disciplinary measure in schools to avert the escalating unrest. Wamalwa says cases of indiscipline were on the rise in the country and caning should be re?introduced in schools as a form of punishment. His counterpart Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has also called for the return of corporal punishment for students in order to rein on the current indiscipline and unrest being witnessed in various schools across the country. Education cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has opposed the proposal to reintroduce caning in schools to curb increasing cases of indiscipline. The said corporal punishment violates students' rights.
