Kenya Power is seeking harsher penalties for power infrastructure vandals and those convicted of tampering with meters, equipment and power theft. The company which says it is losing billions in revenue through vandalism and theft has met with magistrates to sensitize them on the issue as well as tabling it before the parliamentary committee on energy in order to improve oversight. In addition to vandalism and other crimes affecting Kenya Power's operations, the engagement with parliamentary committee on energy and the magistrates also covered the legislative and regulatory framework in the energy sector, Kenya Power's support to the government big 4 agenda, trends and statistics on penalties meted out on convictions forÂ offenses under the energy act, Kenya Power's claims procedure and dispute resolution mechanism in the energy sector, among others issues.
