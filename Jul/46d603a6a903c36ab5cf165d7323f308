East Africa breweries limited EABL has reported a 15% decline in profit after tax, attributing the decline to a one-off tax provision, which slashed performance in what would otherwise have been a relatively good year. The company reported a 5% revenue growth to hit 73.5 billion for the year, as performance significantly improved in the second half with net sales up 10%. Procurement is still a part of a segmented, structure in which the procurement of supplies is a discrete activity in the sequence of activities from the acquisition of suppliers to the delivery of a finished product to the ultimate user. The challenge of global competition is, however, increasingly leading many organizations to replace segmented structures with integrated structures in which procurement is part of a larger grouping.
