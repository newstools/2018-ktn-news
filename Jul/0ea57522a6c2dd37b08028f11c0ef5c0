Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Saturday July 7 handed Kenyan assistant referee Aden Range Marwa a life ban from officiating matches. CAF made an announcement on the decision to axe Marwa following his alleged bribery scandal that was recently unearthed by Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas. Alongside Marwa were ten other referees that were slapped with 10 years ban and 11 others that are under suspension, awaiting their cases to be heard by the CAF board early next month.
