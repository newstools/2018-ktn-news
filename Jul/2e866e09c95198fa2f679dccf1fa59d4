The cost of electricity is set to come down in August following the completion of a tariff review in which the energy regulatory commission (ERC) has reviewed downwards the variable components of the power bill. In the new billing regime the fuel cost charge, foreign exchange adjustment and the inflation costs will substantially go down. This is in addition to the removal of the monthly charge, which has been factored in the energy consumption charge. According to the tariff published on Monday by ERC, fuel cost charge will come down to sh2.50 per unit from sh4.60 in July while the foreign exchange adjustment will reduce 95 percent to five cents in August from sh1.22. Inflation adjustment, which is revised every six months will be charged at five cents from 52 cents gazette in July. ERC said it will gazette the new inflation charge in August and run through December.
