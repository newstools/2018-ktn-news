2016 Kenyan Premier League champions Tusker FC will be seeking their third win this season when they lock horns with leaders Mathare United at the Ruaraka Stadium on Sunday as the league enters its tenth round. The brewers started the season on the wrong footing and are still hovering near the bottom end of the table with nine points having played eight matches. However, after thrashing 12 time league champions AFC Leopards 4?2 on Easter Monday, Sam Timbe's charges will be hoping for another victory.
