High Court Judge George Odunga on Friday fined CS Matiang’i, Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet and Director of Immigration (now Interior PS) Gordon Kihalangwa Sh200,000 for contempt of court. The amount will be deducted from their April's salary. Justice Odunga, while convicting Matiang’i, IG Boinnet, and Kihalangwa, said the war was no longer between the parties but had reached a level where judicial powers were on trial.
