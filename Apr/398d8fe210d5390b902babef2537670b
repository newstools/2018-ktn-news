National Super Alliance (NASA) co-principal Musalia Mudavadi has previously said that his skipping of Raila Odinga's 'swearing-in' did not make him aÂ coward. He said he missed the January 30 event at Uhuru Park in Nairobi "because our tools for fighting for reforms should be constitutional". "We should have a strong alternative government. I wish Kenyans could understand the challenges we are facing as we push for reforms," said Mr Mudavadi after a meeting with elders at the home of Central Organization of Trade Unions Secretary General Francis Atwoli.
