The Kenya ports authority has called on all shippers to support the use of standard gauge railway to reap the benefits of economies of scale and to reduce road congestion. KPA claims 1700 cargos are ready to be delivered and that shippers should collect them. While giving progress on the operations on the standard gauge railway, KPA managing director Mrs. Catherine Mturi Wairi says the number of cargo trains from Nairobi to Mombasa will increase to 5 from the 1st of May and reach daily 6 by 1st June.
