On average, about 7,081 shillings per person was issued out as a bribe in one form or another in 2016. These are the results of a recently released report by the ethics and anti?corruption commission which placed Muranga county as the most corrupt devolved unit of government with the overall number of times a bribe is demanded nationally during the same year increasing by 1.6 times compared to 2015. In an earlier story, we cited Busia County as the most corrupt, but the county was recorded as having the highest average bribery rate.
