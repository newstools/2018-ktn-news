7 billion shillings. That is not the amount proposed for a mega project but the amount the government lost through tax evasion by two suspects. Keval Kumar Maisura and Arti Bakrania were arrested after having been found to have registered more than nine businesses under fabricated names with the aim of defrauding the government. The false names allowed the two to make fictitious invoicing in excess of 15 billion shillings. Officers from Kenya revenue authority (KRA) conducted a search on the residential premises of the two suspects and confiscated crucial documents and electronic devices that aided in defrauding the government in value added tax and income taxes worth a confounding 7 billion shillings. The two were arraigned at Makadara courts where chief magistrate Mbogo Nyaga released the accused on a bond of 15 million shillings with a surety of the same amount or a cash bail of 5 million shillings. The pretrial will be on the 19th of April this year.
