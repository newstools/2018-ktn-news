Wazir Benson Masubo Chacha was Monday detained at Muthaiga Police Station following his arrest in Tanzania on Sunday. Authorities said the suspect was arrested in Tarime by Tanzanian police officers, who handed him over to their Kenyan counterparts. The police had been looking for Chacha for more than two weeks. This was after he was named as the main suspect in the racket involving fake M-Pesa accounts registered in the names of MPs and used to solicit money. Several MPs and other VIPs were duped into sending money in the belief they were responding to distress calls by their colleagues. But the lawmakers discovered the fraud and reported the matter, prompting investigations.
