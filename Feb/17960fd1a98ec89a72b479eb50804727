Siaya High Court Judge Esther Maina has vowed not to bend the law and give an unfair ruling in the election petition challenging the election of Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. Justice Maina warned anyone who might attempt to bribe her to rule in their favour in the case of dire consequences. The judge is presiding over a petition case filed by former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo challenging the election of Governor Rasanga. Justice Maina, who spoke moments before adjourning normal hearing, vowed to give a just ruling in the ongoing case.
