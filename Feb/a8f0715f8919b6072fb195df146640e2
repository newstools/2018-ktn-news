The East African safari rally launched the mini classic rally in tribute to the late Jaideep Vohra, who was the chairman of the rally body. Jaideep perished in a road accident late last year and the race has been slated for 16th to 19th august. Safaricom has sponsored the race to a tune of 4 million shillings in tie that will feature a number of rally drivers, among them, Kenyan veteran driver, Ian Duncan.
