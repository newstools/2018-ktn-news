Three former cabinet secretaries and former state house comptroller Lawrence Lenayapa who have been nominated to serve in Kenyan foreign missions were today vetted by the defense and foreign relations committee of the national assembly. Prof. Jacob Kaimenyi, Willy Bett and Hassan Wario defended their record as cabinet secretaries and outlined their suitability to represent Kenya abroad. But there was a not so diplomatic moment after Wario was asked a question he said touchedÂ on his private life.
