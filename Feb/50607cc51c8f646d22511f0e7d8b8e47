The Kenya Water Towers Agency has been urged to use all the resources at their disposal to tame the rampant corruption in its water sector. Cabinet secretary for environment and forest Keriako Tobiko said the agencies have a critical role to play in the protection of natural resources and therefore need to be managed well. Tobiko was speaking when receiving a report done by the agency on water catchment areas.
