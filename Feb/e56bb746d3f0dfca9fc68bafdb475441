The public procurement regulatory authority has opened investigations into a contract awarding saga at the national hospital insurance fund that could see taxpayers lose 400 million shillings to two private companies. NHIF has been ordered to recover the money from the companies after it emerged that there were massive irregularities in the awarding of the contract. The PPRA is apprehensive that Kenyans may lose millions of shillings if the deal to provide life insurance to civil servants and police officers is allowed to proceed in its current form. In a letter to NHIF executives PPRA director general John Juma has accused the accounting officer of disobeyed orders and instructions of the public procurement administrative review board.
