In recent weeks, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has had to stave off criticism of how he is running the county as well as allegations of criminal associates invoking his name. Sonko who is serving his first time last month had his name dragged into a debacle in which a trader, Timothy Muriuki, was forcefully ejected from a Nairobi hotel and robbed. His assailants, it later emerged, have been in close proximity to the governor and are alleged to be carrying out their illegal activities with his blessing. On another front, there is perceived tension between City Hall and State House, a situation which has reportedly been souring since Sonko’s deputy Polycap Igathe resigned. In the latest “stand-off” between the national and county government, Sonko rejected the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority which was gazetted last year after President Uhuru approved the appointment of the board. However, as the recommendation on the formation of the authority was never approved by Parliament, the body had no legal status. Yet another instance in which Sonko is facing opposition is the demolition of structures in Nairobi either to pave way for upgrades, or to eliminate illegally operating entities. On Friday, souvenir shops in Westlands were brought down and were followed by conversations online in which Sonko’s claim to being a champion of the marginalized, was questioned. Do you think Sonko is losing a handle on properly running Nairobi County? Or are critics piling undue pressure on the governor? Let us know in the comments section below.?
