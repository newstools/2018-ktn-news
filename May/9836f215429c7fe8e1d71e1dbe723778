EACC detectives today morning raided the home of former Transport CS Michael Kamua. The detectives attached to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) raided Eng. Kamau’s Karen Home at around 5:30 am with the intent of arresting him, although it is not clear on which account they raided his home. In 2015 Eng. Kamua was charged with abuse of office claims, but the case was dismissed on account that the anti-graft body was not properly constituted by the time of forwarding names for prosecution. According to our reporter on ground, the detectives have left the home.
