Two multi-million malls under construction in Nairobi, reportedly belonging to a senior official, are among assets the State has targeted in the crackdown on National Youth Service (NYS) scandal. The State has also identified several properties owned by individuals widely mentioned in the scam for recovery as Government freezes suspects' bank accounts. Even as suspects were arrested yesterday, merchants and some public officers who invested proceeds from the sleaze were told their property would be taken. The suspectsâ€™ houses, plots, cars and other personal property have been flagged and earmarked for recovery. Among those set to lose is a senior NYS official, who is said to be constructing two multi-million malls on Kangundo Road, in Nairobi. A businessman whose wife was recently blocked from travelling out of the country will also get a rude shock after his fleet of more than 20 cars was flagged.
