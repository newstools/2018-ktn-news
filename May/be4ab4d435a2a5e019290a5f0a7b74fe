Couples will not have to share their wealth equally upon divorce after High Court on Monday upheld the Marriage, Properties Act. In a landmark ruling, Justice John Mativo rejected the Federation of Women Lawyers’ (FIDA) application for the repeal of section 45 (3) of the Act, that states couples should get what they contributed to family wealth. The judge noted that one could not walk into marriage and walk away out with more than they deserved. Justice Mativo in the ruling added that if the court allowed the request by FIDA, it would create a loophole allow fortune seekers to seek benefit where they did not sow. FIDA nbsp; argued the law unfairly discriminated against women whom it said were always more disadvantaged after the dissolution of marriages. Mativo however dismissed this claim adding that it benefited and protected those who work hard and create family wealth.
