Controversial legislator Babu Owino took an opportunity to greet President Uhuru Kenyatta Wednesday, during the annual State of the Nation address at the National Assembly building. This came as a surprise due to a sustained criticism of the presidency by the MP. The Embakasi East MP also buried the hatchet with nominated Senator Millicent Omanga after months of ugly fights on social media.
