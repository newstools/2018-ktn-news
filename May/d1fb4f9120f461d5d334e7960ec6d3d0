Amidst piling pressure to act on graft,Â President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent out a strongly worded statement stressing that he will not condone public theft in his government. The president has in the past appeared powerless in the fight against corruption with no serious convictions from graft cases despite billions of shillings being stolen from public coffers. Geff Kirui has laid details on the president's tough talk even as Transparency International today recommended a lifestyle audit on all suspects in corruption cases.
