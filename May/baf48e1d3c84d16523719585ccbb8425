Tumaini Innovation Center is a Community Based Organization (CBO) that seeks to address the unique challenge of vulnerable street children and youth of Eldoret. Through the ‘Jenga Vijana’ Campaign, Tumaini Center seeks to equip previously stigmatized street youth with innovative skills through rehabilitation, basic education and vocational training. This transformational journey enables us to eventually integrate them into the community and to create opportunities for them to lead a quality life away from the street. Our approach encompasses a range of activities that are built and sustained on community partnerships geared towards collective investment in addressing the Eldoret street youth challenge.   This campaign aims to raise funds targeting 100 street children to expand our residential, education and training facilities. We will also reach out to over 1000 others through outreach services in sports and music.
