Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has said he will not be destructed by naysayers and cartels, who are hell?bent to make sure that he fails. Speaking on Sunday during a church service at A.I.P.C.A in Njiru ward, Sonko said he is in good working relationship with all his MCAs in Nairobi, despite the claims that they have had strained relations. Over a 100 MCAs had accompanied governor Sonko who has been under siege due to the poor state of Nairobi. Sonko reiterated that he does not require police security after 21 body guards attached to him were withdrawn a fortnight ago.
