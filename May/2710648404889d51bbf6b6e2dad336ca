It is emerging that the National Youth Service has not accounted for ksh.17.5 billion spent in two financial years – between 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 and that the auditor general’s office has been frustrated in its efforts to audit the accounts.  The department of public service and youth says the relevant documents are in the custody of investigating agencies. This emerged today as the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee censured investigating agencies for allegedly blocking the auditor general from unraveling the mystery of the missing billions.
