The Kenya revenue authority (KRA) now says that it will collect an addition 200 billion shillings in five years from spirits following the introduction of the excisable goods management system. The funds which would have been lost will be collected through excise stamp duty which targets spirits, wines, and tobacco products. According to the authority, the introduction of the system in 2013 had seen excise duty collected from spirits triple.Â  This emerged when KRA officials led delegates from different countries across the world in visiting Naivasha based Keroche breweries which have enrolled the management system.
