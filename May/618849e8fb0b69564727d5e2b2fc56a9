A member of the Nyeri County assembly is nursing injuries after she was allegedly attacked by a colleague during a training session in Arusha, Tanzania, last week. Magutu ward MCA Pauline Wanjira, who was in the company of 17 other colleagues, returned to the country to seek medical attention after the altercation. Kenyan police have sought the assistance of Interpol to arrest the assailant, who was briefly held in Tanzania before being released. A police source yesterday said the matter was under investigation and that detectives were set to travel to Arusha. Separate investigations have been started by the Nyeri County assembly, with Speaker John Kaguchia saying the powers and privileges committee had been informed about the case.
