President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga extended their much publicized handshake to their deputies, deputy president William Ruto and NASA principal Kalonzo Musyoka. As the 4 leaders offered an olive branch to each other and apologized for any utterances or actions they might have done during the 2017 hotly contested presidential polls, they resolved to fight the corruption menace in the country as well as champion the building bridges initiative.
