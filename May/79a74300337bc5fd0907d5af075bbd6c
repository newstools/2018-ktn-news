The ministry of health in conjunction with tourism ministry has now allayed any fears of Ebola outbreak in Kenya. Speaking when they surveyed Jomo Kenyatta international airport on the screening of passengers in and out of the country, health CS Sicily Kariuki and her tourism counterpart Najib Balala, maintained there is no case of Ebola in the country and that mitigation measures have been strengthened to contain any suspected case. This comes just days after health officials in the democratic republic of Congo and world health organization reported a new outbreak of Ebola in the northwestern part of the country near Brazzaville.
