Two MPs from Nairobi County are demanding the immediate return of embattled Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to his office in Nairobi, saying the governor has more than enough security at his disposal. The MPs say the governor has an armory at his disposal to offer him protection. ButÂ on his part, governor Sonko said he will no longer use security detail from the national government and will make his own arrangements.
