This is the moment to act decisively on the war against corruption, this is the message a section of political leaders are sending to President Uhuru Kenyatta, as the war against corruption gains momentum. The leaders who include Baringo Senator Gideon Moi want the ministry of agriculture to come clean and explain how money meant for farmers ended up on the hands of cartels and rogue businessmen. The Baringo senator is calling upon the President to crack the whip on all those who are culpable. Elsewhere, deputy president William Ruto has called for action against the culprits.
