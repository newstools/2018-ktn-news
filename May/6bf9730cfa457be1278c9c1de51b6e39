National Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga is known for many things including his love for football. Raila Odinga who is also the patron of Gor Mahia FC, is always present whenever his team is playing a major match. However, Raila seems to have attained an interest in another game, the Squash. On Tuesday 29th May 2018, Raila Odinga was filmed while playing Squash at his luxurious gym. In a statement to Social Media audiences, Raila said that, “I enjoyed playing a game of squash today which is a form of exercise that I take very seriously.” Squash is a ball sport played by two (singles) or four players (doubles squash) in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racket and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. The game was formerly called squash rackets, a reference to the "squashable" soft ball used in the game (compared with the harder ball used in its sister game rackets). It’s now being played as a form of therapeutic exercise.
