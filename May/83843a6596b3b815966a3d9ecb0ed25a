Investigators have summoned more than 40 people for questioning over the suspected loss of 9billion shillings at the national youth service. Those to appear before dci detectives are government officials and business people who had been paid by the agency for supplying various goods and services. On Sunday, public service youth and gender cabinet secretary Margret Kobia sent all NYS officers from procurement, finance and accounting departments on compulsory leave to pave way for ongoing investigations.  And as Murimi Mwangi now reports, Kobia's directive comes only a day before public service principal secretary Lillian Omollo appears before a parliamentary committee over the scandal.
