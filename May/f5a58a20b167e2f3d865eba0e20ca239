The employment court has rescheduled the hearing of a petition to stop the importation of Cuban doctors by the government. This was after it emerged that another petition of a similar nature by three other doctors had already been filed. Hearing of the consolidated petitions will be the defining moment in the contentious importation of the Cuban doctors who are set to arrive in the country.
