Lamu Island today played host to a groundbreaking event as the world’s first fully recycled plastic and flip flop boat was launched into the Indian Ocean.
 
First of its kind, the boat is made using thousands of repurposed flip flops and ocean plastic collected on beach clean ups along the Kenya Coast.
