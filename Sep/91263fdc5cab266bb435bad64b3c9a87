Thirdway Alliance Party leader Dr. Ekuru Aukot has criticized President Uhuru Kenyatta’s proposal of an 8% vat on petroleum products saying in his own words that “the president is actually shooting himself on the foot”. Ekuru insists that the country’s economic state cannot sustain any taxation on petroleum products. The opposition leader instead proposes a reduction of the number of elective seats, a complete scrapping off of regional and county commissioners’ position as well as a reduction of insignificant foreign missions. Dr. Aukot has called on both jubilee and NASA to support his ‘punguza mzigo’ referendum campaign.
