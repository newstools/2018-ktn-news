The German embassy has partnered with farmers from Makueni County to export honey into Europe. This will see the farmers receive a lump sum of more than Kshs 18 million which will draw huge profits for the forest dwellers. The bee keeping business has over the past ten years drawn huge profits in Makueni County. The farmers are known to harvest honey on a quarterly basis with each of a kilogram of honey generating Kshs 350. However, the farmers have called upon Makueni County government to economically empower them by providing them with modern beehives.
