The fate of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula as the Senate’s Minority Leader now lies in the hands of 28 senators affiliated to the NASA coalition. Already 16 senators have signed a petition to replace him with Siaya Senator James Orengo and a meeting scheduled to decide Wetangula’s fate was postponed to tomorrow morning. This comes as the 3 NASA principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula were in Kitui West campaigning for the wiper candidate in the coming by elections, campaigns that Raila Odinga skipped.
