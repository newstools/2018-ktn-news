Germany’s Max Schmitt fired his way to the top of the leaderboard after a brilliant round of six under par on the second day of the 2018 Barclays Kenya open at Muthaiga golf club. And as Moses Wakhisi now reports sadly for the local pros, only two players remained in the running for the cash prize. The two are Sigona’s Mohit Mediratta, who shot one-under par 70 to qualify for the last two rounds and the other player is Windsor’s Riz Charania, who carded his second level par 71 to make it to the money list with 142.
