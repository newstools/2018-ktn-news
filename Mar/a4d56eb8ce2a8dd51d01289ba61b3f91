The alcoholic beverages industry in Kenya has witnessed remarkable growth over the last half a decade. One area that provides a great growth opportunity that exists in Kenya, is the premium beer segment. To address this gap, Warsteiner, Germany’s leading premium beer that has consistently been in production at the Warsteiner brewery for more than 200 years, is officially marking its Kenyan entry next week. Warsteiner has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Maxam, a local firm with over a decade of successful experience in the business. With German companies increasingly showing a keen interest in the economy, Warsteiner’s entry marks a turning point in the firm’s foray into Africa.
