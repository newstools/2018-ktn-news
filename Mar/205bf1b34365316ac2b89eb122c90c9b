Baldev Chager upheld his dogged campaign in search of a maiden top fry classic safari rally title after maintaining his lead on day 2 in Laikipia County on good Friday. Navigated by Ravi Soni Chager in a Kabras Porsche 911, the flying Singh won the opening long and grueling stage to stay ahead of the pack for the second day running. Carl Tundo, who recently equaled Shekhar Mehta's record of five winsÂ dipped quite a bit on the first stage but was back in the groove when he won the second stage to salvage his fortunes. Chager widened his lead with a massive 13minutes over Alastair Cavanagh on the opening stage which was another long drive in Laikipia county. Cavanagh was incidentally fourth fastest on the first stage, a clear indication that his Porsche 911 will be a car to watch.
