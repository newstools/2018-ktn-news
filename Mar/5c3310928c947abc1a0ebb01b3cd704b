Listed carrier Kenya Airways has posted a 6.1 billion shilling net loss for the nine months to December in its latest results. The loss has been linked to high fuel costs and the August elections which affected travel into Kenya. Fuel costs went up by 14 percent in the period. That notwithstanding the airline is optimistic about 2018's outlook amid a planned rollout of daily flights between Nairobi and New York this October, nonstop flights to Cape Town and direct flights to Mauritius. KQ's chief executive SÃ©bastian Mikosz says the full financial impact of the new US route will be felt in 2019, adding he expects a revenue boost of between 8 and 10 percent.
