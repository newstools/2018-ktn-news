The high court has ordered interior cabinet secretary Dr. Fred Matiangi, inspector general Joseph Boinnet and immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa to appear in court Thursday at 10 am for sentencing after finding them guilty of contempt of court. The three have further been ordered to produce Miguna Miguna unconditionally. Justice George Odunga issued the orders with a stinging criticism of the government over its continued disregard of the law. Controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna continues to languish in detention at a location at JKIA since his re?entry to Kenya was denied.
