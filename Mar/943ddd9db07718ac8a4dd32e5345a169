Farmers in Kitui County have been encouraged to engage in cotton farming as an economic activity. Speaking to journalists on Friday, Kitui ginneries operations manager Mary Mwinzi said cotton is one of the bestselling cash crops in the country, noting that farmers are guaranteed good pay upon harvest and delivery. She said cotton was also drought resilient unlike maize and beans and can generate income amongst farmers in the arid county. Cotton has a wide range of products including lint, biodiesel, washing detergent and animal feed, among others.
