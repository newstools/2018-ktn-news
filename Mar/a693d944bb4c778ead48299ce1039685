The African trade insurance and the European investment bank (EIB) has today launched a 1 billion dollar renewable energy facility for sub-Saharan Africa, backed by government of Germany and the EU as part of their commitment to backing the UN’s sustainable energy for all initiative. The facility was launched at the Berne union spring meeting hosted by African trade insurance and supported by government of Kenya. This is the largest meeting the Berne union has ever held in Africa. The African trade insurance agency (ATI), successfully bid to host this year’s annual spring meeting. The previous spring meeting took place in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2017, and was hosted EKF, the Danish government’s export credit agency, under the auspices of their minister of finance.
